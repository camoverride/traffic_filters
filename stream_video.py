"""
This code works by splitting the pipeline into two parts:
    (1) `write_frames` (initiated in a thread) captures frames as they come in.
    (2) `display_frames` displays the most recent frame.

This design prevents lag that might be causes by frame processing, which involves
computer vision and can be slow on certain devices.

    """
    Starts the frame writing process by initializing a frame callback
    that updates the latest frame in a shared list protected by a lock.

    This function calls `write_frames` with a callback that updates the
    shared_frames list in a thread-safe way, allowing other threads to
    read the most recent frame without data races.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shared_frames : List[np.ndarray]
        A shared list intended to hold the latest video frame.
        This list will have either zero or one element â€” the most recent frame.
    lock : threading.Lock
        A threading lock used to synchronize access to `shared_frames`,
        ensuring safe concurrent reads/writes from multiple threads.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        This function runs the frame capture loop and does not return.
        It will typically run indefinitely or until an exception or termination.
